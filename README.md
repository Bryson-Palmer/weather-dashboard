  Weather Bug is a simple weather application that gives you the current weather of any city submitted in the search bar.
Current weather data includes:
* City Name
* Date
* Weather Icon
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Wind Speed
* UV Index

The app also includes a 5-day forecast with the following data:
* Date (1-5)
* Weather Icon
* Temperature
* Humidity

This app uses the `OpenWeather API` to retrieve weather data for cities. It also uses `localStorage` to store the cities searched by the user. This app could be used by travelers to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan accordingly.

  ## üîß <a id='installation'></a> Installation Instructions
  Simply load this url (https://bryson-palmer.github.io/weather-dashboard/) into any browser and start using the application.


  ## üíº  <a id='usage'></a> Usage Information
  Type in a city name (accurately or you'll get an error) into the search field, press the search button, and watch your request load. After you've searched some cities previously, you can press the drop down menu and pick one of those as options. By default, before you've searched any cities upon first use, the app loads the data for Rio De Janeiro. On desktop, both the current weather card and the 5-day forecast card at 100%. If you are viewing on a table or phone, the 5-day forecast becomes a srollable window from side to side.


  ## üîç <a id='future-development'></a> Future Development
  This app is at a good MVP (Minimum Viable Product) state. It functions as requested and expected. The design isn't as sharp as it could be but it's a very good version 1.0. The javascript code could be simplified in many places. For example, it's all in one script file at the moment. I did seperate out a lot of the actions into their own respective functions but I could take it a step further and create classes, store them into their own files, export them, and import them into the index file. This will be an app I want to come back to take it to the next version.
